\begin{abstract}
Recent observations of a bicyclist riding through town and on a treadmill show
that the rider uses the upper body very little when performing normal maneuvers
and that the bicyclist may in fact primarily use steering input for control.
The observations also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees
were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that
there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion
capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system.

We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young
adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider
rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2
km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without
pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with no-hands. These
tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at
various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control
motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization.

Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable
set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this
paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct
kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling.
These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were
drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization-related control
actions.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Much progress has been made in understanding the rigid body dynamics of an
uncontrolled bicycle~\cite{Meijaard2007,Kooijman2008} and various control schemes have been
explored for tracking purposes~\cite{Peterson2008a,Schwab2008,Sharp2008a}, but
little is understood about how a bicyclist actually stabilizes a bicycle during
normal riding. A bicycle and rider system is unique among vehicles in
that the rider is from 80 to 90 percent of the total mass of the system, the
system is laterally unstable, and the rider is flexibly coupled to the
bicycle in such a way that many body motions can be used as control inputs.
Previous research into realistic bicycle control has focused on both steering
and rider lean as control inputs, but there has been no experimental
verification of which motions a rider actually uses for control. Recent
observations of a bicyclist riding through town and on a
treadmill~\cite{Kooijman2009a} show that the rider moves the upper body very
little when performing normal maneuvers and that the bicyclist may in fact
primarily use steering input for control. This corresponds well with the fact
that control by leaning requires high gains compared to the gains required for
steering when employing an optimal control strategy on a
model~\cite{Peterson2008a,Schwab2008,Sharp2008a}. The observations also
revealed
that the rider may use other control inputs such as drastic knee movements at
low speeds. These conclusions were drawn by visually reviewing video data, so a
more rigorous objective method of characterizing the dominant movements of the
bicyclist while stabilizing a bicycle was needed. In order to validate the
hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during normal cycling, motion
capture techniques were used on the bicycle and rider system with the intent to
use principal component analysis to identify the major motion patterns.

Principal component analysis has successfully been used with data collected
from motion capture techniques to identify the dominant modes of motion of a
person walking on a treadmill~\cite{Troje2002} and to characterize different
types of walking. We use similar methods for steady, normal bicycle riding on a
treadmill. Cyclic motions, such as pedaling, are easily identified and
separated from the other less cyclic control actions. Identifying the patterns
of movement gives insight into which body movements are primarily used and are
candidates for control inputs. This will be valuable for our overall research
goals that includes the design of a realistic
biomechanical-based control system of a bicycle rider, among other things.
\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp}
To test our hypotheses, three riders performed a set of stability tasks in a
controlled environment while the motion of the bicycle and rider were collected
with a motion capture system. The tasks were performed on a $3\times5$ meter
treadmill Fig. (\ref{fig:treadmill}) capable of belt speeds up to 35 km/h. The
treadmill was chosen because the envelope of space was suitable for the motion
capture system and it eliminated any disturbances such as wind, rough ground,
and obstacles.  We chose three male riders of similar age [31, 23, 26 years] and
build [height (1.76, 1.84, 1.83 m) and mass (72, 74, 72 kg)]. We also used two
different Dutch bicycles: a 2008 Batavus
Browser with a 3 speed hub and a 2008 Batavus Stratos Deluxe with a 7 speed
hub. The Browser is described by the manufacturer as ``stable'' and the Stratos
Deluxe as ``nervous.''
\begin{figure}

    \caption{The $3\times5$ m treadmill at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.}
    \label{fig:treadmill}
\end{figure}

We made use of the Optotrak Certus Motion Capture
System~\cite{NorthernDigitalIncorporated2009} to record the motion of the
bicycle and rider during the stability tasks. The system is based on active
infrared emitting markers that are placed on the moving bodies and connected to
a central control unit. Each marker emits a sequential infrared signal and the
infrared pulses are captured by camera modules each
containing three cameras. The accuracy of the three dimensional measurements is
$\pm0.15$ mm~\cite{NorthernDigitalIncorporated2009}.
The system has no hardware based noise reduction. Wiring
harnesses were built for both the rider and the bicycles to facilitate easy
bicycle and rider exchange Fig.~(\ref{fig:markers}).
\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \subfloat[]{\label{fig:jodiBikeMarkers}\includegraphics[height=88mm]{jodiBikeMarkers.pdf}}
        \subfloat[]{\label{fig:jodiMarkers}\includegraphics[height=88mm]{jodiMarkers.pdf}}
    \caption{(a) Rider 1 and the Batavus Stratos Deluxe with marker positions. (b) Body marker positions visible from the rear.}
    \label{fig:markers}
\end{figure}

The marker coordinates were measured with respect to an inertial frame,
$\mathbf{M}$, where the plane normal to $\hat{\mathbf{m}}_3$ is coplanar with
the treadmill surface and $\hat{\mathbf{m}}_3$ is directed upward. We collected
the three dimensional locations of 31 markers, 11 of which were located on the
bicycle and 20 that mapped the rider Fig.~(\ref{fig:markerloc}).
\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[height=3.61in]{markerloc.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the marker positions. The rider and bicycle are colored light gray and dark gray, respectively.}
    \label{fig:markerloc}
\end{figure}

The markers were placed on the bicycle so that we could easily extract the
rigid body motion (i.e. body orientations and locations) of the bicycle frame
and fork. Four markers were attached to the fork and seven markers were
attached to the rear frame. A marker was attached on the right and left sides
of the center of each wheel, the seat stays, the ends of the handlebars, and
the head tube. A single marker was also attached to the back of the seat post.

We recorded the locations of 20 points
on the rider Fig.~(\ref{fig:markerloc}): left and right sides of
the helmet near the temple, back of the helmet, shoulders (greater tuberosity
of the humerus), elbows (lateral epicondyle of the humerus), wrists (pisiform
of the carpus), between the
shoulder blades on the spine (T6 of the thoracic vertebrae), the tail bone
(coccyx), midpoint on the spine between the coccyx and shoulder blades (L1 on
the lumbar vertebrae), hips (greater trochanter of the femur), knees (lateral
epicondyle of the femur), ankles (lateral malleolus of the fibula) and feet
(proximal metatarsal joint). The body markers were not necessarily placed such
that a complete rigid body model could easily be fit to the data. This was done
to save setup and processing time because we only wanted a stick figure
representation of the rider that allowed us to visually observe the dominant
motions of the rider.

The stability tasks were designed such that the rider would ride at a constant speed
within the range of 2 to 30 km/h. The bicyclists were told to maintain an
upright straight-ahead course on the treadmill and to look into the distance,
with exception of the line tracking task. The bicyclists were instructed to
bicycle comfortably at the designated speed and data recording was started
at random. In all cases the subject rode at the set speed until comfortable,
then data was taken for 60 seconds at a 100 hertz sampling rate. Each test was
performed on each bicycle with each rider. The following list describes the various
tests:

\begin{description}[Without pedaling]
 \item[Normal pedaling] The subject was instructed to simply stabilize the
     bicycle while pedaling and keep the heading in approximately the forward
     direction. The speed started at 5 km/h and increased in 5 km/h increments
     up to 30 km/h. The speeds were then decreased in the same fashion to 5
     km/h. From then on the speed was decreased in 1 km/h increments until the
     subject was not able stabilize the bicycle any longer. Therefore, there
     were two sets of data for each speed and each bicycle except speeds below
     5 km/h. Several additional runs were also performed with the rider
     pedaling using a different gear and thus a different cadence.
 \item[Without pedaling] This was the same as the normal pedaling task except
     that a string was attached to the head tube of the bicycle such that the
     bicycle was fixed longitudinally relative to the treadmill and no pedaling
     was required. The rider kept the feet in the same position throughout the
     task.
 \item[No-hands] The riders stabilized the bicycle without using steering for
     control. They were instructed to keep their hands on their hips while
     bicycling. The rider started at 30 km/h and decreased in 5 km/h increments
     through 20 km/h and thereafter the speeds were decreased in 1 or 2 km/h
     increments until the rider was not able to comfortably stabilize the
     bicycle.
 \item[Line tracking] This was the same as normal pedaling except that the
     rider was instructed to track a line on the treadmill surface with the
     front wheel. A smaller subset of speeds was performed.
\end{description}
These tasks were designed with the intent to answer several questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What upper body motions are used while bicycling?
    \item How does the system motion change with respect to changes in forward speed?
    \item How does pedaling influence the control actions?
    \item Can the open loop rigid body dynamics be detected in the controlled state?
    \item What does the rider do differently to control the bicycle when riding no-hands?
    \item Do different bicyclists perform similar motions while performing the same task?
    \item Is there a difference in motion when stabilizing and trying to track a line?
\end{enumerate}
Since there is no room to address all of these questions in this paper, we
focus on a single rider on the Browser bicycle and two of the tasks: normal
pedaling and without pedaling. We were able to draw some conclusions on
questions 1 through 4 with this smaller data set.

\section{Open loop rigid body dynamics}
\label{sec:openLoop}
One question we have is whether or not the eigenfrequencies of the weave motion
for the uncontrolled system can be detected in the results from the
stabilization tasks. In order to predict the uncontrolled (open loop)
eigenvalues of the rigid rider system, the basic geometry, mass, center of
gravity locations, and moments of inertia of the bicycle were measured. Also,
the riders were measured and weighed such that the body segment geometry, mass,
center of gravity locations, and moments of inertia could be estimated. The
physical parameter estimation methods are described in \cite{Moore2009a}. This
data was used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the uncontrolled open loop system Fig.
(\ref{fig:eigPlot}).

    attached as a

    stable above 16 km/h, the weave speed.}

\end{figure}

\section{Data processing}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Missing markers}
\label{sec:missingMarkers}
The Optotrak Certus Motion Capture
System~\cite{NorthernDigitalIncorporated2009} is based on the cameras' ability
to detect the infrared light from the sensors so there are occasional gaps in
the coordinate data due to the markers going out of view. We attempted to
minimize this by careful marker and camera placement but were not able to
totally eliminate the error. Any missing markers on the bicycle were
reconstructed using the fact that the bicycle is a rigid body. We had more than
three markers on both the frame and fork, so if one marker location was not
detected we used the relative location of the remaining markers to reconstruct
the missing marker. The gaps in the data of the markers on the human were
repaired by fitting a cubic spline through the data. The spline estimated the
marker coordinates during the gaps. We only used the splined data if the gaps
were less than 10 time steps, or 0.1 sec; otherwise the trials were discarded.

\subsection{Relative motion}
\label{sec:relativeMotion}
We were interested in the analysis of three different marker combinations: the
bicycle alone, the rider alone and the bicycle and rider together. The motion of the bicycle and the
bicycle-rider were calculated with reference to the $\mathbf{N}$ inertial
frame\footnote[1]{The $\mathbf{N}$ frame is used instead of the $\mathbf{M}$ frame
to comply with the vehicle coordinate standards used in \cite{Meijaard2007}. See
Appendix~\ref{sec:inFrames} for the derivation.} and the motion of the rider was calculated
with respect to the rear frame of
the bicycle $\mathbf{B}$ Fig. (\ref{fig:frames}). These three marker
combinations allowed us to differentiate more easily between rider specific and
bicycle specific motions. Furthermore, six of the variables that describe the
configuration of the bicycle in time were calculated to give insight into the
rigid body dynamics. The configuration variables $q_1$ and $q_2$ locate the
contact point of the rear wheel of the bicycle. The $\mathbf{B}$ frame captures
the yaw ($q_3$) and roll ($q_4$) motions
of the bicycle frame, the $\mathbf{D}$ frame is an intermediate frame that
differs from $\mathbf{B}$ only by the bike's headtube angle ($\lambda$), and the
$\mathbf{E}$ frame captures the steering angle ($q_7$) of the bicycle fork relative to
the bicycle frame. The pitch of the bicycle frame ($q_6$) is assumed to be zero. Details of these calculations are shown in
Appendix~\ref{sec:inFrames}.

    \caption{Diagram of the bicycle's inertial frame $\mathbf{N}$, rear frame $\mathbf{B}$, front frame $\mathbf{E}$ and configuration variables.}
    \label{fig:frames}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}
\label{sec:pca}
We used Principal Component Analysis, PCA,~\cite{Jolliffe2002} to extract and
characterize the dominant motions of the system. Calculating the principal
components effectively transforms the space of the data to a space that
maximizes the variance of the data. The typical advantage of PCA is that the
dimension of the system can be reduced and still retain enough information to
adequately describe the system. We are primarily interested in the way that PCA
is able to extract linear components and rank them in order of variance from
the mean position. If we assume that the components with the largest kinematic
variance are motions that are the dominant motions used for control and
propulsion (which in general is not necessarily true for dynamical systems) the
comparison of these components for different riding conditions can give insight
into what motions may be important for developing a biomechanical control model
of the bicyclist.

The repaired data from the motion capture measurements contained the $x$, $y$,
and $z$ coordinates of each marker $1$ through $l$ at each time step $j=1$,
$2$, $\ldots$, $n$. Each marker has three coordinates so there are a total of
$m=3l$ coordinates $i=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $m$. The coordinates at each time step
can be collected in vector $\mathbf{p}_j$.
\begin{displaymath}
    \mathbf{p}_j^T
    =\left[x_{1j}\quad\ldots\quad x_{lj}\quad y_{1j}\quad\ldots\quad y_{lj}\quad z_{1j}\quad\ldots\quad z_{lj}\right]
    =\left[p_{1j}\quad p_{2j}\quad\ldots\quad    p_{mj}\right]
\end{displaymath}
We can organize these coordinate vectors into a matrix, $\mathbf{P}$, where the
rows, $i$, map a single coordinate of a marker through $n$ time steps.
\begin{displaymath}
\mathbf{P}=\left[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
|              & |              &        & |              &        & |             \\
\mathbf{p}_{1} & \mathbf{p}_{2} & \ldots & \mathbf{p}_{j} & \ldots & \mathbf{p}_{n}\\
|              & |              &        & |              &        & |
\end{array} \right]
\end{displaymath}

The principal components were calculated for the three marker combinations as
described earlier where $n=60\cdot100=6000$ time steps. The number of rows of
$\mathbf{P}$ were ($m=3\cdot31=93$), ($m=3\cdot11=33$) and ($m=3\cdot20=60$)
for the bicycle-rider, the bicycle alone and the rider alone, respectively.

One method of determining the principal components is to calculate the
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the mean-subtracted data. We begin by
calculating the mean $\mathbf{u}$ Eq. (\ref{eq:mean}) of the rows of $\mathbf{P}$ and
subtracting it from each column of $\mathbf{P}$ to form the mean-subtracted
data matrix $\bar{\mathbf{P}}$, Eq. (\ref{eq:B}).
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n\mathbf{p}_j
    \label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
A vector of ones
\begin{displaymath}
    \mathbf{h}^T=\left[h_1\quad h_2\quad\ldots\quad h_j\quad\ldots\quad h_n\right]
    \textrm{ where }h_j=1\textrm{ for all }j
    \label{eq:h}
\end{displaymath}
allows us to subtract $\mathbf{u}$ from each column of $\mathbf{P}$,
\begin{equation}
    \bar{\mathbf{P}}=\mathbf{P}-\mathbf{u}\mathbf{h}^T
    \label{eq:B}
\end{equation}
The covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ of $\bar{\mathbf{P}}$ can then be calculated with
Eq. (\ref{eq:C}).
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C}=\frac{1}{n-1}\bar{\mathbf{P}}\bar{\mathbf{P}}^T
    \label{eq:C}
\end{equation}
Calculating the eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_i$ and eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of the
covariance matrix effectively transforms the space to one where the variances
are maximized and the covariances are zero. The eigenvectors are the principal
components of the data set and the corresponding eigenvalues represent the
variance of each principal component. The eigenvectors are ordered by
decreasing eigenvalue where $\mathbf{v}_1$ is the eigenvector corresponding to
the largest eigenvalue. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated by
finding the independent solutions to Eq. (\ref{eq:eig}).
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C}\mathbf{v}_i=\lambda_i\mathbf{v}_i
    \label{eq:eig}
\end{equation}
Each time step can now be represented as a linear combination of the principal
components.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{p}_j=\mathbf{u}+a_{1j}\mathbf{v}_1+a_{2j}\mathbf{v}_2+\ldots+a_{mj}\mathbf{v}_m
    \label{eq:linComb}
\end{equation}
The coefficients $a_{ij}$ can be solved for each time step $j$ by reformulating
Eq. (\ref{eq:linComb}) and solving the system of linear equations.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{P}-\mathbf{u}\mathbf{h}^T=
    \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
        | & | & & |\\
        \mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \ldots & \mathbf{v}_m\\
        | & | & & |
    \end{array}\right]
    \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    a_{11} & \ldots & a_{1n}\\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    a_{m1} & \ldots & a_{mn}
    \end{array}\right]
    =\mathbf{V}\mathbf{A}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{V}^{-1}(\mathbf{P}-\mathbf{u}\mathbf{h}^T)\textrm{.}
\end{equation}
With the principal components $\mathbf{v}_i$ being constant, the behavior in
time is described by the coefficients $a_{ij}$ where the discretization in time
is indexed by $j$. The order of the system can be reduced by eliminating
principal components that have little variance. We arbitrarily decided to
examine the first $k=10$ principal components knowing that the first five would
be based around the larger motions such as pedaling and that the remaining five
may reveal some of the motions associated with control. The variance of each
component, $\textrm{var}(\mathbf{a}_i)=\lambda_i$, is summed to determine the
cumulative percentage of variance of the principal components, $g_k$.
\begin{equation}
    g_k=100\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i}{\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i}\textrm{ where }1\leq k\leq m
\end{equation}
Highly correlated data will show that even when $k<<m$, $g_k$ is close to
100\%. Using 10 components $g_{10}$ covers 100\% ($\sigma=2\cdot10^{-14}$\%) of
the variation in the data for the bicycle, rider and bicycle-rider. The matrix
$\mathbf{A}$ can then be reduced to a $k\times n$ matrix and eigenvectors
greater than $\mathbf{v}_k$ can be eliminated.

\subsection{Data Visualization}
\label{sec:dataVis}
We developed a graphical user interface, ``GUI'',  in \textsc{Matlab} that easily allows
different trials to be compared with one another Fig. (\ref{fig:GUI}). The
program loads in two different trials along with information on each trial. A
graphical representation of the rider and bicycle are displayed in two adjacent
screens and can be viewed from multiple perspectives. The animations of the
runs can be played at different speeds, rewound and fast forwarded. The
principal components are shown beside the corresponding animation display and
combinations can be turned on and off for identification and comparison.
Frequency and amplitude information for the temporal coefficients $a_{ij}$ can
also be displayed for comparison.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Motion identification}
\label{sec:motionId}
The reduced set of data provides two important pieces of information for the
identification of motion: the principal components $\mathbf{v}_i$ and the
corresponding coefficients $a_{ij}$. The principal components represent linear
trajectories of the markers and the coefficients show how the markers follow
the trajectories with time. We began processing the data by reviewing each
principal component of each trial in the GUI and noting what type of
motion we saw Tab. (\ref{tab:trialDesc}). These descriptions were subjective
because we grouped marker movement based on our preconceived understanding of
rider and bicycle motion. Some of the components displayed motions that were not
physically possible such as the upper leg stretching in length during the knee
bounce. This is possible when examining a single component but when
superimposed over the rest of the components the unrealistic motions are not
present. Furthermore, for each component we examined amplitude and frequency
content of the associated coefficients $a_{ij}$ as shown in Figures
(\ref{fig:coef3062}) and (\ref{fig:fft3062}) and noted the shape of the
frequency spectrum and the
frequencies at any distinct spikes.

\end{figure}
Several conclusions can be drawn from examining the coefficient data. First,
some of the components are linked by the frequencies of the coefficients
and describe an identifiable motion. The most obvious of these is that the vertical
and horizontal pedaling components make up the circular pedaling motion.
Both vary periodically and have a dominant frequency which is defined by the
cadence. In the example trial, Tab. (\ref{tab:trialDesc}), the upper body
motions are also linked to the pedaling. Components 8 and 9 both correspond to
a frequency that is twice the pedaling frequency, which may be due to the
forces created during each pedal stroke. Component 6 seems to be the result of a
bad marker signal. Components 5 and 7 are interesting because they display
motions of the bicycle that are not dominated by the pedaling frequency and may
be candidate control motions. The percentage variance of each component gives
an idea of the relative amplitude of the components. The descriptions of each
trial were used to compile a list of motions that contribute to the principal
components. These motions, illustrated in Fig. (\ref{fig:motions}), are:
\begin{description}[Pedaling]
    \item[Drift] The bicycle and rider drift longitudinally and laterally on
        the surface of the treadmill. The motions are typically defined by two
        components that are not necessarily orthogonal or aligned with the
        inertial coordinate system. The motion is random and at low
        frequencies.
    \item[Steer] Rotation of the front assembly with respect to the rear frame.
        The steering may appear linked to one of the pedaling components at the
        pedaling frequency or may be in one or more components sometimes
        combined with roll and/or yaw at more random frequencies, Fig.
        (\ref{fig:steerRoll}).
    \item[Roll] The bicycle and the rider roll with respect to the ground
        plane. Roll is typically linked with steer and/or yaw and often at the
        pedaling frequency, Fig. (\ref{fig:steerRoll}).
    \item[Yaw] The heading angle of the bicycle and rider change together with
        respect to the ground plane. This is typically linked with steer, roll
        and/or the drift, Fig. (\ref{fig:yaw}).
    \item[Pedaling] This motion is defined by two or more components, typically
        a vertical and horizontal motion of the feet, that show the feet
        rotating around the crank axle at a distinct frequency and the legs
        following suit, Fig. (\ref{fig:pedaling}).
    \item[Bend] The spine bent laterally and was always connected with the
        vertical pedaling component, Fig. (\ref{fig:bend}).
    \item[Lean] The upper body, shoulders and head lean laterally with respect
        to the rear frame and was always linked with the horizontal pedaling
        component, Fig. (\ref{fig:lean}).
    \item[Twist] The shoulders rotate about the torso axis. This was linked to
        components that contained steering motions, both random and at the
        pedaling frequency, Fig. (\ref{fig:twist}).
    \item[Bounce] The knee markers bounce up and down, the back straightens and
        the head nods at twice the pedaling frequency, Fig.
        (\ref{fig:bounce}).
    \item[Knees] The knees move laterally relative to the bicycle frame in both
        opposing directions and the same direction at random low frequencies,
        Fig. (\ref{fig:knees}).
    \item[Head] Head twists and random head motions showed up often. These
        seemed to be due to the rider looking around randomly.

\subsection{Motion Characterization}
\label{sec:motionChar}
To identify how bicycling changes with speed it would be ideal to investigate
how the amplitude of each component varies with speed. However, the analysis
does not return the same set of components for each run so such a comparison is
typically not possible. Therefore components were grouped into classes, where
each class shows a specific physically relevant motion. The same total motion
of the class can be described by one set of components in one trial and
another, probably different, set of components in another trial. How the
amplitudes of these classes vary among experiments can be used as a
measure for how the rider and bicycle motion varies among trials.

To objectively identify which coefficients show the same type of motion and
could therefore form a class, the frequency content of each of the time
coefficients in a single trial was correlated to that of each of the other
components in that trial. Next a minimum correlation value was set to determine
which coefficients were correlated to each other. When the minimum was set at
0.9 only the coefficients making up the pedaling motion could be considered
correlated. On the other hand when a minimum level of 0.7 was used practically
every coefficient was correlated to each other. The only exception was the
coefficient that displayed the bounce. Its maximum correlation with another
coefficient was no higher than 0.4 for any of the tested speeds. The 0.8 level
gave a number of distinct classes of components and thus this level was used to
identify which coefficients were connected. Finally, the correlated
coefficients were viewed simultaneously in the GUI enabling the determination
of the motion class.

The correlated coefficients were used to form six different classes of motions,
each made up of combinations of the previously described motions, with
reference to Fig. (\ref{fig:motions}):\\
\\
\begin{tabular}[]{ll}
    Class Name & Class Description\\
    \hline
    Drift & Drift\\
    Pedaling & Pedaling (\ref{fig:pedaling}), Bend (\ref{fig:bend}), Lean
        (\ref{fig:lean}), Twist (\ref{fig:twist})\\
    Steer-Yaw-Roll & Steer and Roll (\ref{fig:steerRoll}), Yaw
        (\ref{fig:yaw})\\
    Bounce & Bounce (\ref{fig:bounce})\\
    Knees & Knees (\ref{fig:knees})\\
    Other & Head and components that showed noise of some
    sort
\end{tabular}\\
\\
In most cases the correlated coefficients described a single class. However, in
some cases this was not the case and the coefficients were used to describe
more than one class. An example is that at low speed the components containing
the drift motions also contained large steer, yaw and roll motions. Therefore,
the motions were placed in both the Drift and the Steer-Yaw-Roll classes.

Since the rider was not instructed to hold a specific location on the treadmill
the Drift class, which was usually the class with the largest amplitude, was
not used in further analysis of the motion and neither was the `Other' class.
For each of the remaining classes, the percentages of variance of the remaining
components were recalculated without the components placed in the Drift and the
Other classes.

We also calculated various configuration variables from the bicycle marker locations
(See Appendix \ref{sec:inFrames}) independent of the PCA perspective for more
specific motion characterizations. This allowed us to investigate the bicycle's
configuration variable time histories and frequency content explicitly.
\subsection{Characterization of motions during normal pedaling}
\label{sec:normalPed}
Figure (\ref{jellybean}) shows how the relative percent variance of the four classes:
Pedaling, Steer-Yaw-Roll, Bounce and Knees varies with speed for Rider 3 on the
Batavus Browser bicycle. The percentage is the average of two runs at speeds 5 km/h and
above. From the graph it
is clear that at 10 km/h and higher speeds practically all the motion that is
taking place is the pedaling motion class. Below 10 km/h, the Steer-Yaw-Roll
class becomes increasingly active and the relative percentage of the motion
taking place in the pedaling class drops. Also at speeds below 10 km/h the
lateral knee motion (Knees) class percentage increases with decreasing speed.
The increase is not as significant as that of the Steer-Yaw-Roll class
(increase to roughly 5\% at 2 km/h), but it is certainly visible. The spike at
4 km/h can be attributed to the fact that the classes may contain higher
variance motions because the classification method is based on principal
components that are not necessarily consistent between runs. The Bounce
roughly remains constant at all speeds.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pedaling4classes.pdf}
    \caption{The relative percent variance of the four classes:
    Pedaling, Steer-Yaw-Roll, Bounce and Knees, at the different speeds when
    the Drift and Other classes were removed from the results for normal
    pedaling. The solid lines are scaled to 100\% (left axis), the dotted lines
    are scaled to 10\% (right axis).}
    \label{jellybean}
\end{figure}

The steer angle amplitude-frequency plot for each of the speeds calculated from
the bicycle rigid body motions is given in Fig. (\ref{pedalsteerangle}). It
clearly shows that the steering actions take place at or around the pedaling
frequency for high and low speeds, respectively. It also shows that the amplitude of the
steering angle increases by 5000\% when the speed decreases from 30 km/h to 2
km/h. Figure (\ref{pedalsteerangle}) also shows the open loop, rigid rider,
weave eigenfrequency for each speed obtained from Fig. (\ref{fig:eigPlot}).
Apparently the open loop eigenfrequency is not a frequency in which the
bicycle-rider operates.

    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{steerangle.pdf}\\
    \caption{Steer angle amplitude plot for the nine different speeds for

    frequency. Dashed vertical gray line indicates the bicycle-rigid rider
    open loop weave eigenfrequency from Fig. (\ref{fig:eigPlot}).}
    \label{pedalsteerangle}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Characterization of motions without pedaling}
\label{sec:noPed}
During normal pedaling, all motions, including the control tasks, are dominated by
the pedaling motions. Therefore we also looked at the motions of bicycle-rider
system without the influence of pedaling. Figure (\ref{missjellybean}) shows
how the percent variance of by Steer-Yaw-Roll, Bounce and Knees
varies with speed for Rider 3 on the Batavus Browser bicycle without pedaling. Since the bicycle
is towed and the riders feet remain in the
same, constant, position relative to bicycle, there is no pedaling class
present in analysis. Furthermore, no bend, lean or twist motions with high
variance were detected during the experiments.
\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{towing3classes.pdf}\\
    \caption{The percent variance of each of the three classes:
    Steer-Yaw-Roll, Bounce and Knees, at the speeds at which the Drift
    and Other classes were removed from the results for trials without
    pedaling. The solid lines are scaled to 100\% (left axis), the dotted lines
    are scaled to 20\% (right axis).}
    \label{missjellybean}
\end{figure}
It is clear that at all speeds most motion takes place in the Steer-Yaw-Roll
class. Also interesting is that unlike in the normal pedaling situation, the
Knee motion percentage does not increase at low speeds. This may mean that the
lateral knee motion is connected to pedaling is some way. Like for the pedaling
case, the Bounce and Knees classes may contain different principal components
and a statistical approach to evaluate the percent variance of the classes
would provide clearer results. Also note that as the bicycle becomes self
stable above 16 km/h the total variance is tiny and thus any sort of random
knee motion can be a relatively large motion.

Figure (\ref{towingsteerangle}) shows the bicycle rigid body steer angle
frequency-amplitude plot for different speeds. Compared to normal pedaling,
the amplitudes are about half the size at the low speeds and one tenth the size
at high speeds, indicating that smaller steering angles were made. The
frequency content now also shows a much wider, flatter spectrum compared to
normal pedaling. At 10 and 15 km/h the frequency with the largest amplitude is
near the open loop weave eigenfrequency. However, at the other speeds this is
not the case, once again indicating that the rigid body open loop weave
eigenfrequency is not the frequency at which the bicycle is controlled.

    tasks without pedaling. Dashed vertical grey line indicates the

\end{figure}
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
The view provided by principal component analysis into bicycle-rider
interaction, biomechanics and control has led us to several conclusions. During
normal bicycling there are several dominant upper body motions: lean, bend, twist and
bounce, all of which seem to be linked to the pedaling motion. This is
important for
understanding which inputs are related to fundamental balance
control and which are reactions to pedaling. We hypothesize
that lateral control is mainly accomplished by steering
since only upper body motion was observed at the pedaling frequency. If
upper body motions are used for control then this control is carried out at the pedaling
frequency. Considering variations of motion with respect to speed, we observed that there is
a great deal of steering at low speeds but this decreases in magnitude as speed
increases. This is generally true for all motions and shows that the
bicycle-rider system becomes more stable at higher speeds with few
detectable control actions. At low speeds additional lateral knee motions are
observed which are probably more effective at augmenting steering control for
lateral balance than upper body motions.

The bicycle model predicts that the weave
mode is stable above about 16 km/h. Intuition might possibly lead one to believe
that if the weave mode is already stable, that weave frequency might be
relatively undisturbed by rider control actions and therefore present in the
closed loop dynamics. However, we found no evidence of a distinct
weave frequency in the steer angle time histories of any run. In fact the only
distinct frequency that sometimes appeared was the pedaling frequency.

Principal component analysis provided a unique view
into the control actions of a rider on a bicycle, but limitations in data
reduction and motion grouping leave room for more objective statistical
views into the motion of the bicycle-rider system.

\section{Inertial frames and configuration variables}
\label{sec:inFrames}
The transformation from marker coordinates to rigid body inertial frames and
configuration variables shown in Fig. (\ref{fig:frames}) is described here. A
reference frame, $\mathbf{N}$, with origin $n_o$ corresponding with the
benchmark bicycle~\cite{Meijaard2007} is defined with respect to the Optotrak
reference frame, $\mathbf{M}$, Eq. (\ref{eq:NtoM}).
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{N}=
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\\
    \hat{\mathbf{n}}_2\\
    \hat{\mathbf{n}}_3
  \end{array}
    \right]
    =
    \left[
    \begin{array}{rrr}
    1 &  0 &  0\\
    0 & -1 &  0\\
    0 &  0 & -1
    \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \hat{\mathbf{m}}_1\\
    \hat{\mathbf{m}}_2\\
    \hat{\mathbf{m}}_3
  \end{array}
    \right]
\label{eq:NtoM}
\end{equation}
Thirty-one marker locations were recorded and the vector to each is defined as
$\mathbf{r}^{{m_{k}}/{n_o}}$ where $k=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $l$ for the original
markers and $k=l+1$, $\ldots$ for any additional virtual markers.  To calculate
the reference frame attached to the rear bicycle we formed a frame center plane
from the seat post marker, $m_{26}$, and two new additional virtual markers at
the center of the rear wheel, $m_{36}$, and the center of the head tube,
$m_{33}$. For example, the center of the rear wheel was calculated by Eq.
(\ref{eq:rearCenter}) where $m_{25}$ and $m_{31}$ are the left and right rear
wheel markers.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{r}^{{m_{36}}/{n_o}}=(\mathbf{r}^{{m_{25}}/{n_o}}+\mathbf{r}^{{m_{31}}/{n_o}})/2
\label{eq:rearCenter}
\end{equation}
The normal vector to the plane through the rear wheel center, seat post and the
head tube center is
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{b}}_2=
\frac{\mathbf{r}^{{m_{36}}/m_{26}}\times\mathbf{r}^{{m_{33}}/m_{26}}}
{|\mathbf{r}^{{m_{36}}/m_{26}}\times\mathbf{r}^{{m_{33}}/m_{26}}|}
\label{eq:b2}
\end{equation}
The heading vector of the rear frame is then
$\hat{\mathbf{b}}_1=\hat{\mathbf{b}}_2\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}_3$ and
$\hat{\mathbf{b}}_3=\hat{\mathbf{b}}_1\times\hat{\mathbf{b}}_2$ follows. These
unit vectors define a reference frame that leans and yaws with the rear frame.
We assumed that the rear frame pitch is negligible. The marker locations of the
rider can now be expressed relative to the bicycle's inertial frame with reference to a point
on the bicycle frame $m_{36}$. Equation~(\ref{eq:wrtRear}) shows that the vector from
any marker on the rider relative to $m_{36}$ can be expressed in the bicycle
reference frame, $\mathbf{B}$, rather than the inertial frame, $\mathbf{N}$.
This formulation was used in the
PCA of the rider-only markers to look specifically at rider motion relative to
the bicycle. The subscripts, $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, in Equation
(\ref{eq:wrtRear}) signify which
reference frame the position vectors are expressed in.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{r}^{{m_{k}}/m_{36}}_\mathbf{B}=
    (\mathbf{r}^{{m_{k}}/m_{36}}_\mathbf{N}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{b}}_1)\hat{\mathbf{b}}_1+
    (\mathbf{r}^{{m_{k}}/m_{36}}_\mathbf{N}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{b}}_2)\hat{\mathbf{b}}_2+
    (\mathbf{r}^{{m_{k}}/m_{36}}_\mathbf{N}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{b}}_3)\hat{\mathbf{b}}_3
\label{eq:wrtRear}
\end{equation}
A reference frame $\mathbf{D}$ that is aligned with the steering axis of the
rear frame can be formulated by rotation about the $\hat{\mathbf{b}}_2$ axis
through the steer axis angle $\lambda$, which is measured for each
bicycle~\cite{Moore2009a}.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{D}=
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \hat{\mathbf{d}}_1\\
    \hat{\mathbf{d}}_2\\
    \hat{\mathbf{d}}_3
  \end{array}
    \right]
    =
    \left[
    \begin{array}{rrr}
    \cos{\lambda} &  0 &  -\sin{\lambda}\\
    0             &  1 &  0\\
    \sin{\lambda} &  0 & \cos{\lambda}
    \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \hat{\mathbf{b}}_1\\
    \hat{\mathbf{b}}_2\\
    \hat{\mathbf{b}}_3
  \end{array}
    \right]
\label{eq:Dframe}
\end{equation}
The handlebar/fork inertial frame $\mathbf{E}$ is then calculated by defining
$\hat{\mathbf{e}}_2$ to be aligned with the front wheel axle Eq.
(\ref{eq:e2}).
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\mathbf{e}}_2=\frac{\mathbf{r}^{{m_{21}}/{n_o}}-\mathbf{r}^{{m_{27}}/{n_o}}}
                            {|\mathbf{r}^{{m_{21}}/{n_o}}-\mathbf{r}^{{m_{27}}/{n_o}}|}
\label{eq:e2}
\end{equation}
The handlebar/fork frame rotates around $\hat{\mathbf{d}}_3=\hat{\mathbf{e}_3}$
and then $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1=\hat{\mathbf{e}}_3\times\hat{\mathbf{e}}_2$.
Equation (\ref{eq:rr}) gives the instantaneous rear wheel radius.
\begin{equation}
    r_\mathbf{R}=
    -\frac{\mathbf{r}^{{m_{36}}/{n_o}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_3}
    {\hat{\mathbf{b}}_3\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_3}
\label{eq:rr}
\end{equation}
Which is used to formulate the vector to the rear wheel contact point Eq.
(\ref{eq:r39}).
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{r}^{{m_{39}}/{n_o}} = \mathbf{r}^{{m_{36}}/{n_o}}+r_\mathbf{R}\hat{\mathbf{b}_3}
\label{eq:r39}
\end{equation}
This now allows us to calculate six of the eight configuration variables of the
bicycle as a function of time ($q_5$ and $q_8$ are the rear and front wheel
rotations, respectively).
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Distance to the ground contact point: }q_1 = \mathbf{r}^{{m_{39}}/{n_o}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}_1}
\label{eq:q1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Distance to the ground contact point: }q_2 = \mathbf{r}^{{m_{39}}/{n_o}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}_2}
\label{eq:q2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Yaw angle: }q_3 = \arccos\left(\hat{\mathbf{b}_1}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}_1}\right)
\label{eq:q3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Roll angle: }q_4 = \arccos\left(\hat{\mathbf{b}_3}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}_3}\right)
\label{eq:q4}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Pitch angle: }q_6 = 0
\label{eq:q6}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Steer angle: }q_7 = \arccos\left(\hat{\mathbf{d}_1}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{e}_1}\right)
\label{eq:q7}
